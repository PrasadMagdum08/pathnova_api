        "description": "This topic focuses on developing and evaluating attacks specifically designed to manipulate the performance of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities in these models and propose countermeasures to improve their robustness. This research can have applications in natural language processing and cybersecurity, as NER models are widely used in various domains, including text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis. Students will need to have a strong understanding of machine learning, NLP, and cybersecurity principles.",
